## Introduction

### Company Profile

TechForge is a leading full-stack development company specializing in seamless frontend, backend, and DevOps integration. By employing cutting-edge technologies, TechForge delivers high-performance, scalable web solutions that ensure optimal user experiences and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.

### Problem Statement

The backend web development department has been receiving increasing complaints from the frontend development team and end-users regarding slow API response times. This performance lag is negatively impacting the user experience, causing delays in page load times and broken functionality, especially during peak traffic hours. The performance degradation is unpredictable, making it difficult for the backend and DevOps teams to proactively address the issues.

Despite manual monitoring efforts, the root causes of these API performance issues remain elusive. This is compounded by the complexity of the backend architecture, which includes microservices, third-party integrations, and a dynamic cloud infrastructure. As a result, the current approach is reactive rather than proactive, leading to recurring issues and strained inter-departmental communication.

### Approach

To address this, the backend and DevOps teams can use AI-powered API performance monitoring tools like **Datadog** and **New Relic** to:

- Detect anomalies in real-time and flag performance issues automatically.
- Pinpoint root causes quickly with AI-driven analysis.
- Predict and prevent future issues with proactive monitoring.
- Improve cross-team collaboration through intelligent alerts.
- Continuously monitor and optimize API performance for a better user experience.

These tools will help shift from reactive fixes to proactive performance management, improving API reliability and reducing friction between teams.
